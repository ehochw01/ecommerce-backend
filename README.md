# E-commerce Backend

## Description
This is back end server that connects to a mysql database that allows you to keep track of ecommerce data data. This application will allow you to keep track of, add, edit, and delete product categories, products, and product tags.

## Usage
Download the repo and run "npm install" in the root folder of the repo. Then go to the ./db folder and run mysql. In mysql, run "source schema.sql" to load the database that will be used for the application. Then exit mysql. To exit mysql type "exit". You will have to now add your .env file to get sequelize to work with mysql. If you want to feed the database with test data, go to the root folder and run "npm run seed" in the terminal. Then to start the server, run "npm start". Now you will be able to run the api routes. A demo of this can be seend in the Links section.
